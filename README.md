- 👋 Hi, I’m @Alice-1031
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in deepening my understanding of biological systems and
-    their underlying processes,using the power of computation and statistical analysis.
-    
- 🌱 I’m currently an undergrad pursing a dual major in Computer Science and Data analytics
-    with a domain in Biology and Math.
-    
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simulation models especially for scientific projects, but not
-    having specialized yet and with many hours of coding to do before I master the skill, I am open to any projects - 
-    backend for web apps would fall right under my current level of experience from past projects in Java and a good grasp of concepts in
-    object oriented programming, data structures and algorithms and computer architecture. I am currenlty pursuing more projects in C++ 
-    as it is the most common language in use for academic models, in addition I am skilled in the use of R for statistical analysis and familiar
-    with the basics of information security and network motinoring,bash scripting and SQL.
